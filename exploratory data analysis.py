# # Dynamic Time Warping

# Dynamic Time Warping
# Dynamic time warping finds the optimal non-linear alignment between two time series. The Euclidean distances between alignments are then much less susceptable to pessimistic similarity measurements due to distortion in the time axis. There is a price to pay for this, however, because dynamic time warping is quadratic in the length of the time series used.
# 
# Dynamic time warping works in the following way. Consider two time series Q and C of the same length n where
# Q=q1,q2,...,qn
# and
# C=c1,c2,...,cn
# The first thing we do is construct an n√ón matrix whose i,jth element is the Euclidean distance between qi and cj. We want to find a path through this matrix that minimizes the cumulative distance. This path then determines the optimal alignment between the two time series. It should be noted that it is possible for one point in a time series to be mapped to multiple points in the other time series.

# One distinctive observation that we can make from the above plots is that from the period starting roughly from 
# 15th january 2018 onwards,we notice that some of the the stock indices and the price behave similar to each other,specifically falling and rising together.
# 
# As we turn our attention towards the VIX vs price plot,we find that the series' move in the opposite directions
# roughly around the start of february 2018,we see a fall in the bitocin price and a sharp rise in the VIX index.
# Since, the VIX index measures the volatility in the market or an investor's gauge of fear,we see that there is a sharp increase in the VIX index(scores more than 35 which indicate volatility) and a fall in the bitcoin prices.
# 
# This could be owing to the volatility in the market at that time.
